### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently debating on updating some of my software that's on here along with reviving some old ones I've never released, and some that I've released before.

- Learning GitHub as I go along. It's something I had not used much of, so this profile is something new compared to a few things I've done on here before.

There's a few things kind of planned, that will be introduced sooner or later.
